# Plexis

Plexis a breakout clone I wrote in C++/CLI because I wanted to play around with DirectX and experiment with an idea I had revolving creating GUIs using XML. It's built on top of a simple engine I wrote that makes use of DirectDraw 7 for graphics, DirectSound 8 for audio and DirectInput 8 for input. The level editor is written in C#, using WinForms; you'll need the .NET Framework 4.5 or later to run both the game and the editor.

The latest build of the game is in the _builds_ directory. All the source code is released under the MIT license.
