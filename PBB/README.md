PBB is in design mode; things are changing each day and nothing is set in stone as yet. Furthermore, the engine is being written
from scratch using DirectX 8 - an older version of DirectX is being used for a reason - which is going to be used in a (much) bigger future project, so it's both a game and a testing ground for the engine.
Currently, most of the engine has been designed and time is starting to be spent on the functionality of the games interface. 
The game is being designed to be highly data driven via XML, so you can customize and modify it to a high degree without
writing any code (that includes the in-game menus).

Pseudocode for the game and engine is located in the pseudocode directory. The root directory of the project contains
architecture.dia which is a UMLish diagram of the engine and game architecture. It's not meant to be strict UML but most
people should be able to follow it (I hope *cough*). Each XML schema will be documented as it's finalized.
